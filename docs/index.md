Hello, we are... this  is about...

# Goals, and our dataset

For the goal of this project we try to create a CNN that...

Our dataset for these experiments consists of homemade pictures of fruits. The dataset contains 7 fruit classes, `apple`, `banana`, `kiwi`, `onion`, `tomato`, `orange`, and `mandarin`, for each of these classes we have around 190 pictures from various angles including different sceneries and even fruits that are partially obscured. All of the images are labeled with the type of fruit in the picture and the weight of that piece of fruit.
