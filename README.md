# Object Property Inference

Our project will be about infering properties about objects from an image,
specifically we will focus on a dataset consisting of images of fruits and
vegitables, from which we will try to infer their mass.

### Our dataset

Our dataset will consist of images of fruits and vegitables bought by ourselves.
To clean up the images we will...
We will resize these images to AxB
