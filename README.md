# Computer Vision by Deep Learning

A repository for the Computer Vision by Deep Learning course 2021.
Project group 3: Koen du Buf and Olivier Dikken.
A blog about the project is present in the docs folder, and hosted
[here](https://koendubuf.github.io/CVbyDL-Object-Property-Inference/).

# Object Property Inference

Our project will be about infering properties about objects from an image,
specifically we will focus on a dataset consisting of images of fruits and
vegitables, from which we will try to infer their mass.

### Reference papers

[Estimate mass of regular objects from images](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v78/standley17a/standley17a.pdf)\
[Deep CNN to estimate length and weight of fish](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.6618)

### Our dataset

Our dataset will consist of images of fruits and vegitables bought by ourselves.
We will resize these images to AxB, and label them by both their class of fruit,
and by their weight. This way we can get statistics about performance overall,
and per class of fruit if we want to.
